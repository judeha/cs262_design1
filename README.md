Thanks for coming to our multi-client server chat! 

### Instructions for Usage
1. Download the repository
2. On Command Line Interface (CLI) run 'python server.py'
3. Open a new CLI window and run 'python client.py '--host --port --protocol'. We have defualt values for these three parameters. The protocol is set as a default to JSON (0), but you can opt into using the custom protocol by changing the flag to 1.
